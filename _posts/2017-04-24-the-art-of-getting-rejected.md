title: "The Art of Getting Rejected"
---
It's so propelling to see how at the beginning of every year people make up their mind to follow a resolution and how they fail 95% of the time. I even bought a domain, a day before the New Year’s Eve of 2016 (You can actually verify it [here](https://who.is/whois/shashankgaurav.com) :p) and the plan was to publish my first post on the first day of 2016.  But like every other New Year’s resolution, this too was abandoned. A few days back, I helped a friend set up her blog which rekindled my year old plan with a slight change. This is going to be more of a series of rants, with a few bits of advice for all engineers in a similar predicament.

Lately, the word “rejection” has become a tad more frequent than I’d prefer.  More specifically, rejection in Job Interviews. Till date, I have sent in applications to over 100 companies and interviewed at 20-25 companies. For all my efforts, I received offers from two companies with decent profiles. I should have been content with these, had it not been for the hard work put in while appearing for interviews at companies like Microsoft IDC, Amazon, Commvault, Symantec, HackerRank etc.

At this point, you’re probably wondering why should you care? You can always learn about interview experiences from websites like Glassdoor, but those are nothing more than disconnected incidents from disconnected individuals. I, on the other hand, intend to focus on the entire story. A story of diverse interview experiences of a single person in multiple companies. Each experience brings with it a better understanding of the plethora of mistakes that can be avoided, and how to learn from them.

I am still applying for jobs and you might be wondering why, even though I already have two offers. The reason might be a little egotistical, but it's pretty simple: I can't settle for mediocrity. An ideal company for me would meet these criteria:

1. They should offer a decent package. (Let's be honest, this matter)
2. They should at least have a score of 10 on the [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/).

You might think I am greedy for wanting a good package. Well, maybe I am. I don’t want to worry about money when I should be focusing on giving my best at work. I wish to work on interesting and challenging problems alongside brilliant minds. This scenario isn't something that an average company can provide. 

Over the next few days, I hope to channelize this blog post into two categories, one with on-campus interview experiences and other with off-campus experiences. I’ll map out my preparation plan, the application process for off-campus placements, and most importantly, the mistakes I made. I believe you can learn as much from somebody’s failure as you would do with their success. So here's hoping that you can benefit from mine.
